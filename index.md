## About me

I am an [IST-BRIDGE fellow](https://ista.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/) at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), hosted by [Matthew Kwan](https://mkwn.github.io/). I completed my PhD at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), under the supervision of [Angelika Steger](https://inf.ethz.ch/de/personen/person-detail.steger.html). Before that, I did my Master's degree at ETH Zürich and my Bachelor's degree at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/).

## Research interests

My research focus is on extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, more specifically random graph theory, Ramsey theory, and combinatorial design theory. I am also interested in theoretical computer science, in particular algorithms and complexity theory.
